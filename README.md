# Compile_GUI
Quake Map Compiler GUI

I have been vibecoding with ChatGPT and Gemini as well as others. Some of that are Quake1 related projects.

This is a python GUI for compiling Quake 1 maps. It is targetted to use EricW's tools found at https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools/
It will likely work with other compilers (though not all options/flags will be the same)

Usage is pretty straight forward.

My original prompts seem to be lost currently. I know I went through several iterations with ChatGPT before getting everything working properly.
